# Incident Management Process Analysis

## ðŸš€ Overview
This project involves the analysis of an incident management process for an IT company, using data extracted from the ServiceNow platform. The dataset consists of over 141,000 events from 24,918 distinct incidents, detailing various aspects of incident resolution, including categories, urgency levels, priority, and impacted services.

The analysis focuses on:
- The frequency of incidents across different levels of urgency and impact.
- The performance of users in handling and resolving incidents.
- The relationship between incident priority and resolution time.
- The analysis of incident categories, close codes, and the average time to resolve incidents.

The visualizations have been created using **Tableau** to provide insights into incident management performance and highlight areas for improvement.

## ðŸ“‚ Files
- **Incident_Management_Process.twbx** â€“ Tableau workbook containing the visualizations and dashboards.
- **incident_dataframe.csv** â€“ CSV dataset containing the incident management log, with information on categories, urgency, priority, and user details.
- **Incident_Management_Process.docx** â€“ Detailed report explaining the dataset, the analysis performed, and key findings.

## ðŸ“Š Key Insights
âœ” **Incident urgency and impact**: The majority of incidents fall under medium urgency and medium impact.  
âœ” **User performance**: The analysis reveals which users are most responsible for updating incidents and resolving them.  
âœ” **Incident priority and resolution**: Higher-priority incidents tend to have shorter resolution times, but there are exceptions based on category and user.  
âœ” **Incident categories and close codes**: Some incident categories and close codes are more frequent than others, indicating patterns in incident types and resolutions.

## ðŸ”§ Techniques Used
1. **Data Preparation**:
   - Cleaned and transformed the raw incident log data to ensure consistency and accuracy.
   - Used **Tableau Prep** (or similar tool) to manipulate the data for easier visualization.

2. **Data Visualization**:
   - Created various types of visualizations in Tableau, including:
     - **Column charts**, **treemaps**, and **scatter plots** to visualize incident urgency, impact, and resolution.
     - **Packed bubble charts** and **treemaps** to show user contributions and incident duration.
     - **Bar charts** and **line graphs** to observe patterns in resolution time and incident categories.

3. **Analysis**:
   - Analyzed incident data across various dimensions, such as impact, urgency, priority, and category.
   - Identified the most common combinations of incident attributes and observed the relationship between priority levels and resolution times.


## ðŸ“Œ Tools Used
- **Tableau Desktop** (for data visualization)
- **Microsoft Word** (for the documentation)

## ðŸ’¡ Conclusion
This project demonstrates how data visualization can be used to gain insights into the incident management process, optimizing IT operations and improving efficiency. By analyzing incident trends and user performance, IT teams can identify areas of improvement, optimize resources, and ensure quicker incident resolution.
